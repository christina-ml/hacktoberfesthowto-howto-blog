# Hacktoberfest History

{{< figure src="/images/2014-2019Shirts.jpg" width="1000" >}}

I'm no expert, but I've been able to collect images from the internet starting from Hacktoberfest in 2014, showing the logo and the t-shirt from each year.

# No shirt.
# Why isn’t there a t-shirt this year? 
# Good question!  Here is the response from the official Hacktoberfest page (originally posted at [https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#faq](https://web.archive.org/web/20231009172722/https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#faq)):

> As Hacktoberfest has grown, so have the logistical challenges associated with creating a reward. Unfortunately, it’s no longer feasible for us to provide a free t-shirt. Nevertheless, we still want participants to have a memorable experience and receive a special memento marking their participation and the year.
>
> **Instead of a t-shirt reward**, we’re partnering with Holopin and our sponsors to provide digital rewards, making global delivery much simpler. We believe this shift will allow Hacktoberfest to continue supporting and raising awareness for open-source projects worldwide for years to come.
