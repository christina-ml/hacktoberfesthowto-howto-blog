# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
This repo is the source code for a static site, written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Markdown.
Instead of installing the framework, I set up the repo to run in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

What you'll want to do:

Option 1: Make your change inside of Gitpod and preview the changes

- Make a fork of this repo to your local user.
- Sign up for a free Gitpod account at [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/).  You can use your GitHub user to sign in.
- Open your fork in Gitpod (it may be useful to install the Gitpod extension for your browser for this).
-- The URL to open will look something like https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/yourusername/howto-blog

- Make the needed or desired changes.
- You should be able to see a preview of this inside of Gitpod.
- Commit the changes and create a pull request.


Option 2: Make the change directly in GitHub.
- Make a fork of this repo to your local user.
- Go to the file you want to edit. Click the pen to edit the file, or press"." to open Visual Studio Code inside the web browser.
- Make the needed or desired changes.
- Commit the changes and create a pull request.

Please note:
Your pull/merge requests must not be spammy. For example:
- Automated PR/MRs: scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace, fix typos or optimize images.
- Disruptive PR/MRs: taking someone else’s branch/commits and making a pull request.
- Anything that a project maintainer flags as spam.
- Anything that looks like an attempt to duplicate your pull request count for October.
- Multiple PR/MRs for the same issue that are unnecessary - for example five PR/MRs to remove a stray whitespace.
PR/MRs that are labeled with a label containing the word “spam” by maintainers will not be counted towards Hacktoberfest.
PR/MRs that the Hacktoberfest system detects as spammy will also not be counted. (It uses the Node.js RegEx engine with `/\bspam\b/i` to look for spam labels.)
<!-- **The information below is more for maintainers than contributors**
PR/MRs that also have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
PR/MRs that have been merged and do not have a label containing the word “invalid” cannot be marked as spammy via a label.
-->
Any user with two or more spammy PR/MRs will be disqualified from Hacktoberfest.
